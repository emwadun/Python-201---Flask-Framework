<!-- This is the front-end. User will input data in text box, and click Add to send data to backend code-->
<!-- line 3 : HTTP POST method to send data to main page , i.e. / route which is the same we defined in out .py file. By default Flask routes accepts only GET requests -->
<!-- line 4 : text input, this will associate any text input with name title -->
<!-- line 5: a submit button with text Add shown on it-->

    Lines 9-12 loop through all of the books that we passed from the back-end code and display each 
    title in a new HTML paragraph. Jinja's syntax is very similar to Python's, 
    but it has some differences. We use 'curlbracket and percentage' to indicate that we're using a Jinja control 
    pattern (in this case, a for loop), and we use 'doublecurly braces' to indicate that we're referring to a 
    variable instead of a raw string. We also need to use 'curlbracket and percentage' endfor 'curlbracket and percentage' to close our for loop because, 
    unlike Python, Jinja doesn't regard white space as significant.
